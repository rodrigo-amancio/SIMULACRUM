                <p id="first-p">It’s clear that reality only works for a privileged minority, but designers advocate a realist approach, which means they work within the constraints of reality as it is, for the minority. The school aims to challenge this by making reality a little bit bigger to provide more room for different kinds of dreams and hopes. An important part of this process is generating multiple versions of reality, and this is where design comes in.</p>
                <p>We concluded,” he said, “that the only way to challenge this unsatisfactory situation was to be unrealistic—to breach realism’s heavily policed borders and to fully embrace unreality.</p>

                <p>The phrase ‘real world’ is something most designers (and academics) will be familiar with—as a rallying cry, as a critique, as a justification. But what is this real world, and where is it? More importantly, this suggests there is also a ‘not real world’: where does this not exist? And who decides what is real and what is not (what can and what cannot not exist)?</p>
                <p>Speaking as committed objectologists fascinated by objects of all kinds whether real or unreal, we both find it perplexing, when confronted with a certain kind of object, to hear a person claim that it is not real. Yet, there in front of us is a thing, taking up space, existing, being in the world. Ok, the values it embodies might be at odds with those around us, and its purpose or reason for existing might be abstract or cerebral, but surely, if it actually exists as a physical object, it is real.</p>
                <p>This binary view, which divides the world of ideas, things, and thoughts into ‘real’ and ‘not real’ is extremely damaging to the fostering of imagination and its ability to uncover alternatives to how things are now. Especially when the word ‘unrealistic’ often simply means ‘undesirable’ to those in charge, rendering alternative realities impossible for everyone else. Designers need to move beyond this binary approach to dividing up thoughts, ideas and things. They all exist after all, just in different ways, somewhere, otherwise it would not even be possible to think them. Design needs more nuanced ways of understanding and talking about this relationship. One that acknowledges that the real and the not real are just two poles on a subtle and rich spectrum.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Existing entities (eg tables and chairs), non-existing entities (numbers and ideas), fictional entities or ficta (eg Sherlock Holmes, King of France, unicorns), impossible objects (eg round squares) and even unthinkable objects (ie having the property of being unthinkable). For many philosophers, Theory of Objects is a mess; in fact it is known as “Meinong’s Jungle”, which in itself is appealing to us. It is a conceptual space where all kinds of weird objects are welcome and even celebrated. This is our new intellectual home. Theory of Objects gives equal importance to things that can only exist in fiction or in the imagination as it does to concrete or actual objects such as chairs and mountains. Designers say there is the real and the not real, and that they want to deal with the real. Meinong says there is the real, the sort of real, the hyper-real, the not quite real, the really real, and so on. We want to be in this world. A world that more fully reflects the range of realities and unrealities that people interact with daily.</p>
                <p>In a time when many people’s lives are shaped as much by fictional entities as supposedly real ones, designers need to take the fictional side of things more seriously, to embrace unreality, and Meinong’s Theory of Objects is one way of thinking about this.</p>
                <p>The process of deciding on what is considered real, and what is not, is where politics and the imagination meet: “If politics has become a struggle for people’s imagination this is, in the first place, due to the fact that such a struggle takes place within human beings and not just among them…” Politics today is a battle over the imagination, and work that operates on the imagination by either maintaining pre-existing realities, or by challenging them through alternatives that encourage people to question prevailing world views becomes political. Being aware of this as designers is “doing work politically”, to borrow and slightly modify Thomas Hirschhorn’s phrase; for practitioners, the politics are in the ‘how’, not the ‘what’. In this way the unreal becomes political—political in the sense that it can challenge the limits people place on their own imaginations when it comes to thinking about, and questioning, what is possible.</p>
                <p>But where could work like this happen? Academic and cultural organisations seem like a natural home for the unrealistic, impossible and yet to exist zones where the unreal can be experienced, considered and enjoyed. And this is why it is time for design—so often only concerned with the pragmatic and realistic—to join those whom the writer Ursula Le Guin calls “the realists of a larger reality”, by embracing unreality, and beginning to design for the unreal world.</p>
                <p>All this talk of fiction and imaginary objects might seem esoteric and quite abstract, but fictions are everywhere—money, numbers, law, nations, financial markets and Pokémon. It is becoming clearer each day that the boundaries between what most people think of as real, concrete and existing, and that which they deem imaginary, nonexistent and intangible, are fluid.</p>
                <p>Differences between the real and the unreal are not so clear, in reality. A group of scientists researching what happens in people’s brains when they are confronted with real and fictional entities recently concluded that “the categorical distinction between reality and fiction that we employ in daily life appears to be too simplistic and non-representative of our phenomenological experience. The term ‘real’ in itself does not have much explanatory power, as it means only that something objectively exists.” These experiments focussed on the identification of two zones in the brain, the amPFC (anterior medial prefrontal cortex) and PCC (posterior cingulate cortex), which are activated to greater or lesser degrees when encountering fictional and actual characters. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain tells the difference between reality and fantasy and what criteria it uses. At the moment it is related to relevance. Fictional characters for example are less relevant to most people than real characters, although gamers, for example, might not agree—something that they plan to test later.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Clearly there are certain features of reality that are fixed, at least for the time being—science concerns itself with these—and there are certain unthinkable imaginary objects that can never exist anywhere, or even be thought. But these are the extremes. In between, there is a rich and fascinating space from which unknown realities might one day emerge. Not just things, but also beliefs, values, hopes, ideals and dreams—the raw material from which new realities can be constructed.</p>
                <p>By capturing screenshots of these images in Google Earth, I am pausing them and pulling them out of the update cycle. I capture these images to archive them - to make sure there is a record that this image was produced by the Universal Texture at a particular time and place. As I kept looking for more anomalies, and revisiting anomalies I had already discovered, I noticed the images I had discovered were disappearing. The aerial photographs were getting updated, becoming 'flatter' – from being taken at less of an angle or having the shadows below bridges muted. Because Google Earth is constantly updating its algorithms and three-dimensional data, each specific moment could only be captured as a still image. I know Google is trying to fix some of these anomalies too – I’ve been contacted by a Google engineer who has come up with a clever fix for the problem of drooping roads and bridges. Though the change has yet to appear in the software, it’s only a matter of time.</p>
                <p>Taking a closer look, Google’s algorithms also seem to have a way to select certain types of aerial photographs over others, so as more photographs are taken, the better ones get selected. To Google, better photographs are flatter, have fewer shadows and are taken from higher angles. Because of this progress, these strange images are being erased. I see part of my work as archiving these temporal digital typologies. I also call these images postcards to cast myself as a tourist in the temporal and virtual space - a space that exists digitally for a moment, and may perhaps never be reconstituted again by any computer.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>By ‘constructed realities’ we mean alternative realities that have been consciously constructed with a purpose in mind. These are different from virtual and augmented realities, which are the media through which constructed realities might be communicated, made or experienced. They don’t have to be objects, but are more than just narratives. A story or an idea becomes a constructed reality at the moment it is given form and materially embodied whether as an object, stage set or photograph. Despite the name, constructed realities are different from Berger and Luckmann’s socially constructed realities. They are more than social conventions; the emphasis is on their construction, how they are made and what they are made from; they therefore have some physical objectivity. They are consciously made or fabricated realities rather than found realities. But ‘fabricated’ sounds a bit like ‘faked’, which suggests hoaxes—which they are not.</p>
                <p>In 2010, an image from Google Street View began circulating online. The image showed a car parked on the pavement near a man holding up a baby a woman beside him had just given birth to on the street, just as a Google Street View car was passing. The discussion focussed on whether it was real or fabricated. One of the better articles was on a blog called sippey.com in an entry entitled “even if it’s fake it’s real”.10 Here the ‘real’ equalled truthfulness. Related to this, but a bit closer to what we are thinking of, is the Cross-Quadrant Working Group, a website that gathers examples organised into Real-Real, Real-Fake, Fake-Fake or Fake-Real: “The Quadrants are an aide to categorizing and sense-making for an increasingly complex world around us, a world in which what is actual and what is illusory are often difficult to disambiguate. Because if a myriad of forces, from cheap technology to global media to fragmented politics to re-thinking of the self, playing with the lines between objective, socially agreed reality and types of manufactured ‘realities’ has become easier and more pervasive. Having a means of typing these phenomena is a first step to both understanding, and eventually operationalizing, tactical and strategic uncertainty.”</p>

                <p>If it is perceived to be real, then for all intents and purposes it is, as it influences behaviour, beliefs and therefore actions that have consequences on people’s experience of the world in which they live. A related example concerns the test sites used by car and technology companies for testing conventional and self-driving cars, or military simulations of distant villages and landscapes for training solders to do battle in remote, and for them, alien realities. Both begin to approach our notion of a constructed reality; something that blends different kinds of real and unreal, and moves beyond representation to presentation. The users of these spaces and viewers of these shows know these places are not pretending to be anything more than they are, they are simulated rather than fake realities—unreal, yet concrete. Constructed realities are not fake; they do not hide their status as constructions—in fact, they celebrate it. Glimpses of this can sometimes be seen on film sets where green-screen props and costumes are juxtaposed with everyday scenes. They lay bare the seams joining different kinds of reality together. They are real in the sense that they exist in the same space as the viewer, but they reference an alternative reality—political, social, cultural, ethical, philosophical and so on.</p>
                <p>They are devices for shifting attention away from the here and now, to the yet to exist, possible and—as of now—unreal. If realities are constructed rather than given, can they also be designed, and what does this mean for design? At least one direct outcome is the end of the real as something straightforward, monolithic, shared, solid, authentic and honest. And an acceptance that the unreal is equally as important, a space for uncovering realities as of yet unknown, which are more than variations on what already exists.</p>
                <p>Although Meinong’s theory of objects has been contested, it appeals to us as designers due to the equal importance it gives to ideas, thoughts and objects whether they actually exist or are imagined, or, in Meinong’s words, have or do not have ‘being’. We began to wonder if the extremes of his taxonomy might serve as inspiration for an aesthetic approach to fictional objects which highlights the seams joining together different kinds of realities—an aesthetics of unreality. If, rather than cautiously stepping back from unreality, we stepped through the looking glass, what kind of new design opportunities might we find on the other side?</p>
                <p>It would probably take us away from naturalism, realism and the attempt to create an illusion of reality, and instead allow us to enjoy the designed nature of constructed realities. Meinong’s theory of objects might provide some clues about how to show the seams, how realities and unrealities fit together. Embracing estrangement rather than verisimilitude, ambiguity rather than fixed meaning; openness to suggest different realities, rather than tightly linking to a correct version; and abstraction rather than figuration, with ties to the known and everyday.</p>
                <p>In some ways, this relates to ‘possible world’ theory, where every fiction creates a new world in the reader’s imagination. Design can do this too. By working with anthropologists, political scientists and social theorists, it can contribute to the proliferation of multiple worlds existing in the collective imagination, enlarging it to provide a richer conceptual space from which to uncover alternatives to the present and consider the kind of world(s) people wish to live in. A form of interdisciplinary imagining that aims to inspire further imagining, rather than communicating a vision of how things will or should be.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>In design, when a project steps away from the ‘here and now’, it is automatically relocated to the future, often a ‘possible’ (realistic) one. But futures, as a narrative framework, are too limiting for the kind of thinking we are talking about here. They restrict the imagination through the requirement to link back to the present, which of course they are nearly always some version of, or extensions of current worldviews. We are more interested in starting with alternative worldviews and using design to give them form. They can be in the future, in the past, or a parallel present, but most importantly for us, they are simply: Not Here, Not Now.</p>
                <p>In this role, the designer’s task is to give form to a multiverse of hidden possibilities that contribute to a culture of imaginative alterity materialised in ways that engage the mind by challenging it, shifting its focus, arresting it, motivating and inspiring. Raising awareness that if reality is not given but made, then it can be unmade, and remade. This is not simply about the re-imagining of everyday life—there are plenty of examples of this—it is about using unreality to question the authority of a specific reality in order to foreground its assumptions and ideology.</p>
