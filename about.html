                <p id="first-p">Our world is made up of stories, mutated views, hallucinations we tell ourselves, references we repeat to others and anecdotes we call truths. They make up a semi-consensual reality both online and offline, they also filter reality… denying some stories, whilst inflating others and attaching the tag of conspiracy to a few in between. This modus of a narrative is to simply search for meaning and understanding, which is inevitably a human trait. Without it we find ourselves gasping for air in the endless abyss of the existential nightmare, completely atomized from any sense of The Self or meaning. Yet this state of being tethered to reality is not something one does alone, it’s a collective process.</p>
                <p>Fiction is both real and not-real in the same way. It is about real social worlds, but it’s also imagined. How do you design for unreality, and what should it look like? How should the unreal, parallel, impossible, unknown, and yet-to-exist be represented? And how, in a design, can you simultaneously capture the real and not-real?</p>
                <p>But why are these hidden realities interesting for the aesthetics of speculation? We think it is because they border on the unreal themselves, and it is very hard to believe many of them are real. They embody extreme values that for some have no place in this world. They seem to belong in a parallel world where extreme aspects of our own world have somehow metamorphosed into whole environments. For us, these are the proto-images for an aesthetics of speculation. They suggest a techno-poetic landscape situated somewhere between what we are and what we have the potential to become.</p>

                <p>This project was developed as a part of Project I, Master’s degree in Communication Design, 2022—2023, Faculty of Fine-Arts of ULisboa. It constitutes an approach on post-digital imagery as a way of producing unreality, a way of merging the diffuse limits of reality, and redefining human perception and its emotional limits. SIMULACRUM was intended as a conceptual approach on how the immersion in post-digital images, combined with human perception and the persistence of our emotional limits, blurs the boundaries between real and unreal, and redefines our understanding of what constitutes reality.</p>
                <p>Human emotional limits are the constant in every ramification projected by SIMULACRUM. It goes beyond our own perception and breaches a world of produced realities, not only as an existential approach, but also as a speculation on how design, fiction and cinema explore emotional unrealities.</p>
